# extunes
Python script to export iTunes plist data for playlists and sync music files to other devices.

Apple have migrated from iTunes.app to Music.app.
In Music.app you can export an xml version of the library by going to the "File" menu and choose the "Library" option and using "Export Library..." which lets you save the xml version which should still work here but you will need to manually export it each time.
